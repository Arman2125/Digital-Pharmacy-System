DIGITAL PHARMACY SYSTEM
📌 Purpose of the Project

The Digital Pharmacy System is a web-based application designed to modernize pharmacy operations by providing an easy-to-use interface for managing medicines, prescriptions, and users. The goal is to reduce manual work and improve efficiency in pharmacy management.

⚙️ How It Works

Users can browse medicines and view details through the frontend interface.
Admin/pharmacist can manage medicine listings and inventory (planned).
Backend APIs will handle authentication, medicine data, orders, and database operations.
MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing application data.
⚠️ Note: Backend development is currently in progress.
